1. Found Interesting:
    a. one billion for child development centers
    b. expansion of egov app
2. Found Weird:
    a. free healthcare things (??)
    b. lack of anti-gambling action
3. Reflection:
President Bongbong Marcos’ 2025 State of the Nation Address felt like a well-rehearsed checklist—new classrooms, more power plants, free surgeries, and a digitized government wrapped in sleek acronyms like eGov and ARROW. It was hard not to feel a spark of hope hearing about a future that promised health coverage for the poor, education for children in forgotten barangays, and policies aimed at inclusivity. These promises weren’t just numbers; they were answers to long-held needs. For once, it felt like someone remembered the far-flung towns, the sick who couldn’t afford chemo, and the students learning with broken chalkboards. There was even talk of a billion pesos for children—an amount I can’t even imagine holding in my hands, now supposedly placed in the hands of those who need it most.

But as I listened longer, that feeling of hope started to unravel into doubt. How could we celebrate a “historic rice harvest” when people are still skipping meals? How can we talk about growth, when wages haven’t grown with us? A country doesn't live in headlines or acronyms—it lives in tricycle drivers, public school teachers, street vendors, and minimum-wage workers who still wake up every day hoping they can afford to live another. And while the president's words painted a bright future, reality—our reality—still flickers in brownouts and unpaid bills. Progress, it seems, is only real if the people feel it. Otherwise, it’s just noise. What the SONA gave us were promises. What we need now is proof.
